This is a continuation of challenge 3. We get a new URL. Opening the new URL now shows that the system has been updated with more security. We can login with the same 4 example users. Doing so as Bob shows the old vulnerability is now fixed. The developer directory still shows 5 developers.

Back at the login screen, we still only see 4 example users. Alice is missing.

The logins for the 4 example users are however quite basic with the users name and 3 numbers. Bob's password was `bob321`, Emma's `emma456` (or something like that, we can't quite remember since we didn't write it down). From that we can assume Alice's password may be as simple. 

Suprisingly, the first thing we tried: `alice123` worked. We got in and found the flag in Alice's portfolio!
